## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git and GitHub

### What I learned

Actually everything I used in this challenge I already knew, I am using these exercises to practice and master these skills. Although as I avance in the difficulty of the challengues i will begin to learn new ones

### Continued development

One of the things that I think would be very useful and would make me improve a lot is to learn a css framework and technologies like React. 

### Useful resources

- [My Notion Notes](https://outstanding-guarantee-3ee.notion.site/Responsive-Design-Maquetaci-n-Mobile-First-de047b48d1c8405cb58854d0c220fcfa?pvs=4) - Notes from Platzi's Mobile First course. This helped me to refresh the information I saw in that course and to apply all the best practices.
- [My code notes](https://github.com/Aleclto7/apuntes) - Notes I write in the code while learning and taking the courses. The description of each label helped me to refresh their uses and applications.
